Official Go implementation of EXO network.

> EXO, short for Exodus Network, is a project aiming to rebuild the
> computing network that will be truly open, decentralized, dynamic, safe, shared and
> owned by the community.

## Introduction

Exodus uses the originality of blockchain technology to propose a POSTT (Proof of Space Time and Task) consensus Algorithms to build a two-layer consensus deployment architecture of "cross-fire networking and fully intelligent device nodes", relying on the Internet of Things Multi-Hop technology flexibly networking, activate massive distributed on line intelligent equipment. Form a decentralized shared computing Efforts to allocate and trade markets. 

Exodus will efficiently and securely reach consensus through smart contracts and distribute on demand,Transparent settlement, resource price customization without third-party intermediary. 

Serve for intelligent manufacturing, virtual AR, film and television animation,Artificial intelligence, big data, scientific computing and other industries with high computing power demand.

## Technical Highlights

1.  Founded by the Stanford University team ranked first in computer science
2.  The core technical team is also a code technology consultant team for large companies such as Facebook and Tesla
3. Obtained capital injection from several North American venture capital companies, including SOS Venture, Citizen Venture, Brave Soldier and other established venture capitalists
4. Multiple international invention patents, seven parallel patents can be searched in China
5. Has extensive market experience and partners, including Matter-port, Decorilla, We VR and other post-production companies
6.  Activate the user's idle computing power, green mining is no longer a waste of resources
7.  Original consensus algorithm: POSTT + two-layer node deployment, original TASK task scenario consensus
8. There are rich landing scenarios and actual business models, and multiple off line business cooperation interfaces
9.  A keen market awareness, rich market resources, and successful experience of multiple god-level projects

Combined with cutting-edge technologies such as grid computing, MESH networking, and on-chain settlement, the idle computing power of a large number of users is recalled and distributed to studios, laboratories, and enterprises in need.

Advocate cheap, environmentally friendly and efficient resource utilization. After the design of Exodus's underlying architecture and smart home node is completed, the concept of E-Planet will be built, and a complete CDN network will be built through Sharding.

Smart refrigerators, sweeping robots, routers, mobile phones, company servers, and cloud storage nodes have all become consensus nodes, contributing computing power to E-Planet. By assigning tasks Provide idle GPUs, CPUs, and encrypted tokens as settlement methods to provide value services and realize the ecological application of virtual wisdom computing planets.

### Computing Resource Trade

Exodus Network's working method is to gather the computing power of tons of idle smart devices, evaluate and reorganize the computing power through the POSTT algorithm network, and provide it to business organizations that need computing power, so that the entire economic model is organized in a balanced supply and demand.

### Computing Resource Schedule

Exodus network computing power pool is composed of user computing power pool and cloud computing power pool. The computing power pool is mapped into corresponding virtual computing power resources through the Exodus network, and is uniformly scheduled by the scheduling system.

 The computing power pool interacts with the scheduling system through the scheduling gateway, and the scheduling system allocates according to the network's task request and current computing power resources. Scheduling data is exchanged by a special data gateway and data system to achieve the purpose of balancing and rationally allocating computing resources.
